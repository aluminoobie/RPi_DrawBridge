Track 1: STEM for Kids
   This exciting track is designed to teach children (grades 7-10) to interface with a Raspberry Pi and peripherals.  Students will learn to setup the Raspberry Pi hardware, configure the Raspian Operating System, connect General Input/Output devices, and program the operating system to interact with those devices.  Students will spend the afternoon in a team practical application exercise.

Track 2: Educator and Parents
  This track is for educators and parents who want to learn more about information technology and security education.  The SANS Cyber Aces program will be introduced as a training platform to education students in information technology subject areas.  The track also consists of foundation classes on computer networking, operating systems, social engineering, scripting, and programming.  Each class will include education on the subject and open source reference to use in academic settings.
